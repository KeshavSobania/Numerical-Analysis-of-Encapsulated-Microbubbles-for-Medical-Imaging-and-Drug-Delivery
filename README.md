# Numerical-Analysis-of-Encapsulated-Microbubbles-for-Medical-Imaging-and-Drug-Delivery
## Overview
This project focuses on the numerical analysis of encapsulated microbubbles used in medical imaging and drug delivery. The aim is to understand how encapsulation elasticity affects microbubble dynamics, including growth and dissolution, through the development of a mathematical model.
## Key Features
* Develop a Mathematical Model: Create a model to analyze the effects of encapsulation elasticity on microbubble behavior, considering factors such as surface tension and gas concentration.
* Literature Review: Conduct an in-depth review of existing research and fundamental equations to understand the critical factors influencing microbubble stability.
* Numerical Simulation: Formulate and solve governing equations using MATLAB, applying the Runge-Kutta method to simulate microbubble dynamics under various conditions.
*Analyze Saturation Effects: Investigate how different saturation levels in the surrounding medium impact microbubble stability, aiming to enhance imaging contrast and optimize drug delivery.
## Team Contributions
In our team of six for the Ideal Rankine Cycle project, each member played a vital role. I focused on conducting research and developing the MATLAB code for performance analysis. Other team members contributed by handling the research, report writing, and calculations, including formulating equations and performing analyses. Special thanks to Ishan Agarwal, whose significant contributions were instrumental in the project's success.
