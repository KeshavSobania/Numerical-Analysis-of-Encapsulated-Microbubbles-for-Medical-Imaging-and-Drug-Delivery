# Numerical-Analysis-of-Encapsulated-Microbubbles-for-Medical-Imaging-and-Drug-Delivery
Overview
This project focuses on the numerical analysis of encapsulated microbubbles used in medical imaging and drug delivery. The aim is to understand how encapsulation elasticity affects microbubble dynamics, including growth and dissolution, through the development of a mathematical model.
